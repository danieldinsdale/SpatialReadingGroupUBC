#Presentation Notes  
Each presentation is ~45 min and ~30 slides.  We probably need 1-2 people to present each one.

##Presentation 1):  Intro to spatial stats
An overview of the topic.  Initial forays, clasical stats, and simple motivation example

###Motivation
3-4 slides?  
* Specific challenges of spatial stats
  * Correlation
  * Continuous process but discreate measurements
* EG the tin min


###Basics
* Variograms
  * their parameters
  * Interpretation
* Correlation structures
  * Exponential/spherical?
  * Mattern
* MLE
* Prefferential sampling

###Example
* Tin mine?
* R packages
* 

###Inherrent challenges
* Prefferential sampling
* Over confidence in estimated parameters
* Non linearity of parameters


##Presentation 2): Bayes and INLA
