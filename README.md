## Abstract

Spatial statistics is the field of study concerning statistical methods that use space and spatial relationships directly in their mathematical computations. In this presentation, we will give an overview of spatial statistics, including, variograms, frequetist and Bayesian parameter estimation and prediction. Finally, the methods are applied to a real data set.
