#Presentation Notes  
Each presentation is ~45 min and ~30 slides.  We probably need 1-2 people to present each one.

##Presentation 1):  Intro to spatial stats
An overview of the topic.  Initial forays, clasical stats, and simple motivation example

##Motivation
~5min
3-4 slides?   (Adrian)
* Specific challenges of spatial stats
  * Correlation
  * Continuous process but discreate measurements
* EG the tin min


##Basics/Classical stats
20-25 min
3-4 slides max
* Correlation structures
  * Mattern
  * Exponential as special case
* Variograms (Adrian)
  * their parameters
  * Interpretation

3-4 slides
* MLE (Bo/ Jasmine)

1-2 slide
* Krigging (Bo)

###Inherrent challenges
4ish slides
* Prefferential sampling (Danny)

3ish?
* Non linearity of parameters (Adrian/Joe?)
* Over confidence in spatial predictors  (part of Bayes?) Hand over


##Bayes (Joe)
15-20 min
* MLE of Tin data
* Why there is more uncertainty that this represents

###INLA
* How
* Advantages

###Comparison of INLA and MLE

###Example
* Tin mine?
* R packages
*
